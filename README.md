# Selenium WebDriver Tutorial Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive guide on using the Selenium WebDriver API for automating web application testing. Below are the key topics covered:

1. **Launching and Interacting with Websites**: Learn how to use the WebDriver API to open and navigate through websites.
2. **Locating Web Elements**: Techniques to find buttons, links, text fields, dropdowns, and more within a web application.
3. **Interacting with Elements**: Perform actions like clicking, entering text, reading text, selecting dropdown options, handling popups and alerts, uploading files, and working with iframes.
4. **Advanced Interactions**: Master hovering over elements, sending special keys (e.g., tab), and working with symbols.
5. **Integration with Test Frameworks**: Understand how to integrate WebDriver API with assertion libraries like TestNG for robust test validations.
6. **Page Object Model (POM)**: Organize your test code using POM to enhance reusability and readability.
7. **Wait Strategies**: Learn various techniques for managing script timing and preventing flaky tests through explicit, implicit, and fluent waits.
8. **Taking Screenshots**: Capture screenshots during test execution for reporting and debugging.
9. **WebDriver Event Listeners**: Implement custom listeners to log test activities and perform additional actions during execution.
10. **Browser Customization**: Customize the browser environment for test execution, including running headless tests.
11. **Advanced Browser Features**: Manage multiple open tabs, cookies, and more within your test scripts.
12. **Custom Actions with JavaScript**: For complex interactions, extend WebDriver capabilities by writing custom JavaScript commands.
